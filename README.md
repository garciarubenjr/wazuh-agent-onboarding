## Wazuh Agent Onboarding Script (Linux)

This repository provides a **clean, automated script** to install, enroll, and activate the **Wazuh agent** on Linux systems using Wazuh’s **official deployment variables method**.

The script is designed for:

- 🧪 Home labs
- 🛡️ SOC / Blue Team practice
- 🔁 Repeatable VM onboarding
- 🌐 GitHub-hosted, pull-and-run deployments

---

## ✨ What This Script Does

When executed on a Linux VM, the script will:

- Install required system dependencies
- Add the official Wazuh APT repository and GPG key
- Install the Wazuh agent package
- Enroll the agent automatically with the Wazuh Manager
- Enable and start the agent service
- Perform a basic health check

✅ No manual key exchange or post-install configuration is required.

---

## 🧱 Requirements

### Supported Systems
- Ubuntu 20.04 / 22.04 (tested)
- Debian-based systems (should work)

### Network Requirements

The target VM must be able to reach the Wazuh Manager on the following ports:

| Port | Protocol | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| 1515 | TCP | Agent enrollment |
| 1514 | TCP | Agent communication |

If you are using **pfSense** or another firewall, ensure these ports are allowed between the agent and the manager.

---

## 🔐 Enrollment Password (Important)

> 👉 **This is NOT the Wazuh Dashboard (UI) password.**

- Configured on the **Wazuh Manager** for agent enrollment
- Used **only once** during agent registration
- After enrollment, the agent authenticates using **cryptographic keys**

💡 Think of it as a **join token**, not an admin credential.

---

## 🚀 Quick Install (Recommended)

Run the following command on a new Linux VM:

```bash
sudo -E MANAGER_IP=192.168.10.100 ENROLL_PASS='YourEnrollPassword' \
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/garciarubenjr/wazuh-agent-onboarding/main/install_wazuh_agent.sh)"

🔧 Environment Variables
Variable	Description
MANAGER_IP	IP address of the Wazuh Manager
ENROLL_PASS	Agent enrollment password
AGENT_NAME	(Optional) Agent name (defaults to hostname)
AGENT_GROUP	(Optional) Wazuh agent group (default: default)
WAZUH_VERSION	(Optional) Wazuh repo version (default: 4.14)
Example: Custom Agent Name and Group

sudo -E MANAGER_IP=192.168.10.100 \
ENROLL_PASS='YourEnrollPassword' \
AGENT_NAME='web-server-01' \
AGENT_GROUP='linux-servers' \
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/garciarubenjr/wazuh-agent-onboarding/main/install_wazuh_agent.sh)"

✅ Verifying Successful Enrollment
On the Agent

sudo tail -n 50 /var/ossec/logs/ossec.log

You should see:

Connected to the server (192.168.10.100):1514

On the Wazuh Manager

sudo /var/ossec/bin/agent_control -lc

The agent should appear as Active.
In the Wazuh Dashboard

    Navigate to Endpoints → Agents

    Confirm:

        Status: Active

        Last keep alive: Current

🛠 Troubleshooting
Agent installs but shows Disconnected

Check that:

    The manager is reachable on ports 1514 and 1515

    The enrollment password is correct

    No duplicate agents exist from reused VM snapshots

Reusing VM Snapshots

The script removes any existing agent keys before enrollment to avoid duplicate or stale registrations.
🧠 Design Notes

    Uses Wazuh’s official deployment variables (cleaner and recommended)

    Avoids manual editing of ossec.conf

    Avoids interactive key management

    Suitable for GitHub-hosted one-line installs
